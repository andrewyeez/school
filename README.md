#School#
School.java will be my main class.
##Application##
I will use MySQL to store the information and I will be using json files to seed my database.  
There will be very basic functionalities like students enrolling to a course and leaving a course.  
Teacher owning a course. Some basic rules like Courses can have no teacher and Admin will have method  
that will expand its scope throughout all the models in the application.  

###Models###
Admin
Course  
Student  
Teacher  

###Relationships###
Student has many courses  
Teacher has many courses  
Course has one Teacher 

##Testing##
I have not looked into java testing but I am familiar with JUnit so I might just end up using that.
